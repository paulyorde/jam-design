if recorder has started - message and condition for effect to not start.

if effect is on when stop record 
then effect should remain on


1. check effects state on dispose, connect, disconnect
 - playerStop 
    - context.suspend -> resume on play
 - recordStart
    - resume 
 - recordStop
    - suspend 
    - dispose? 


- visualize effects on / off


2. create functions for effects toggeling
    - createEffect(effectToCreateString)
    - toggleEffectStatus
        - isOn? -> stop()
        - isOff -> start()
    - toggleEffectOn?()
        - powerStatus
        - mute 
        - connect
    - toggleEffectOff?()
        - powerStatus
        - mute 
        - disconnect

3. streamline effects up to recording 
- should keep effects on after stop recordin
- should message if effects cliked after recording started

4. get id of effect object, 
- if disposing do we need to make another?

5. distortion isn't working 
- build custome one (audio context with 0 output latency) or use effects plugin 


6. download ins't actually mp3.
- needs sample rate
